ImageInfo - written by Larry Bank

A command line tool to quickly display information about image files. ImageInfo
was written as a lightweight replacement for ImageMagick's Identify program.
If you're only interested in identifying an image type and it's size, the tiny
size of the ImageInfo executable and its behavior of reading the minimum number
of bytes to identify a file allows it to run several orders of magnitude faster
than the Identify program.
